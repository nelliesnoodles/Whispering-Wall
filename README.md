Testing and methods are tried out on this code before being implemented on the online whispering wall.

Wiwa's code has a list of hateful words (slurs) she will not parse.  
I will add more words as I am informed of them.  
I do not want my chatbot engaging in conversation where these words are used. 
If you have words you think I should add, you can DM my twitter account and let me know.
